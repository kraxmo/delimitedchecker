# delimitedchecker
Checks files and directories for properly delimited record data

Delimited record data is both simple delimited and does checks for embedded delimiters within text strings but has not been tested for other advanced settings (such as embedded quotes within quotes if quoted "text string").

See test_delimitedfilechecker.py
